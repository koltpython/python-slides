# Evil Laughter

> Explanation and examples are taken from: https://evil.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Laugh

In the many medias based on text (comic books, novels, some videogames), it became common to represent an evil laugh through the constant repetition of an onomatopoeia that expresses a laugh. "HAHAHAHAHA" was the most simple and used representation of the evil laugh, but soon many variations appeared, to give more personality to to the villain and his laugh. Some variations are as follow:

- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! (The most typical of laughs)
- MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! (A more malevolent type of laugh)
- BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! (A rounder and fuller laugh)
- GWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! (Same as above)
- NHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
- HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO! (A kind of chuckle)
- GACK ACK ACK ACK! (Form of a cough and a laugh)
- MUH HUH HUH HUH!
- Heh heh heh (A laugh often used for controlled anger)
- HEEHEEHEE! (A giggle)
- HAH, HAH!
- HAR, HAR!(The laugh of a villain with generally low intelligence)
- EEYAH HA HA HA!
- MWEE HEE HEE HEE! (A mentally deranged laugh)
- UWEE HEE HEE HEE! (Same as above)
- BLEH HEH HEH HEH HEH!
- YEAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! (Form of a shout and a laugh)
- NEEHEEHEEHEEHAHAHA!!, an evil laugh normally done by Dr. Carver.
- KYHAHAHAHAHAHA!!, the evil laugh used by Beyond Birthday of Death Note

As you can see from the examples, evil laughs have a common pattern.

Let's analyze MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

1. They start with a prefix: MWA
2. They repeat a string some amount of times: 7 times HA
3. They end with some amount of exclamation marks: 1 !

## Our Task

Today we will implement a program that creates an evil laugh for a villain.
We will then modify our code to respond with an evil laughter to everything user enters.
